# hello-world

Hello, 
  My name is Esteban Gracia. I am relatively new to coding. So far, I have programmed in Java and C++. Although I am stil very raw, I am very eager to learn more about the world of programming. Eventually, I want to dive into web development. My goal with this site is to post all sorts of projects; big and small. By doing so, I will be able to look back and see how I am progressing. Hopefully this small introdcution provides a small insight of who I am.
